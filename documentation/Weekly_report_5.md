# Week 5  

[Hour report](https://github.com/uberballo/MapGenerator/blob/master/documentation/hour_report.md)

## What has happened during week 5   

* OpenSimplex noise now functions correctly
* small modifications to the algorithms
* Tests are implemented


Now the core function of the app should be ready. There are few ways to see how these algorithms compare to each other, time and the quality of the noise. 

## Problems  
Nothing big now.

## Next 
Read the review and think on it. Small fixes here and there.
