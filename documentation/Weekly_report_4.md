# Week 4  

[Hour report](https://github.com/uberballo/MapGenerator/blob/master/documentation/hour_report.md)

## What has happened during week 4   

* Added OpenSimplex noise
* small modifications to the algorithms
* Research

Bit slow week, I added the OpenSimplex noise, which is noticeable better than the other two. The game map drawing is still bit shabby, but I will fix it asap.

## Problems  
The colors need to have different shades.

## Next 
Fix the color, documentation and testing for OpenSimplex
