# Week 2  

[Hour report](https://github.com/uberballo/MapGenerator/blob/master/documentation/hour_report.md)

## What has happened during week 2   

* Added Value noise and Perlin noise
* Added UI and graphics, that show off the different types of noise
* Added tests

Actually realized that my first noise algorithm was a Value noise, not Perlin noise. Classic Perlin noise uses gradient array to calculate the noise.

## Problems  
Need to think how I can draw the map from the values. Size of tiles, type of tiles, etc.  

## Next 
Try to produce a better picture then a black and white noise.
