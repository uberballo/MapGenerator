# How to use

## Installing  
Easiest way is to download the .jar file from the release tab. The program requires Oracles java version 1.8 to run, or other similar that has JavaFX support.  

## How to use  
Application can be started by running the command `java -jar FILENAME.jar` and the user interface should come on the screen.  
On the application right corner, there are all the possible types of noise algorithms to choose from. By pressing one of them, a picture comes on the screen.  
There are 3 sliders, Frequency, Octaves and Amplitude. Frequency determines how often the "lines" change direction, resulting more uneven terrain. Octaves is used in some algorithms to calculate noise more often. Resulting more stronger effects from frequency and amplitude. Amplitude amplifies the terrain, increasing the minimum and maximum height of the terrain.  
When done, users may exit the program by pressing the X key on the right hand corner.
