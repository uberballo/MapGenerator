# Week 3  

[Hour report](https://github.com/uberballo/MapGenerator/blob/master/documentation/hour_report.md)

## What has happened during week 3   

* Added UI
* small modifications to the algorithms
* Research

The current algorithms have some problems with higher octaves,frequencies and/or amplitude. Sometimes the corner are black, not resembling the noise function. Some of them are unavoidable, as it is obvious that with higher values we receive receive all black map.  
There are some problems with the Value noise algorithm, as there are these lines on the top right corner.  


## Problems  
What is my Classic noise algorithms time complexity? Is there a fix to the previously mentioned problems?  

## Next 
Implement the OpenSimplex noise and a better game map colors.
