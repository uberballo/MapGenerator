# Week 1  

[Hour report](https://github.com/uberballo/MapGenerator/blob/master/documentation/hour_report.md)

## What has happened during week 1  

* Project creation  
* Version control setup  
* Experimenting with Perlin noise and OpenSimplex noise.  
* Designing how the project itself would be built  

Most of the time went into studying Perlin noise itself. I have grasped the whole idea itself, but still have some dificulties understanding OpenSimplex noise. Implementing OpenSimplex noise is really easy, but the classic Perlin noise is bit harder. I made a one Perlin noise maker, but it doesn't yet work correctly.

## Problems  
I need to somehow find how to manipulate the output of these noise generators. I have found way to manipulate the amplification, but not the frequencies.  

## Next 
Try to implement both of these noise makers and output a .png picture that shows initially, how these maps would look like.
